\section{Testing}
I am going to hand compile and trace a series of programs to validate that the system is functioning correctly, as well as demonistrating various error messages the compiler can produce should it encounter syntax errors within the source code. I will also demonstrate how the graphical display and debugger for the virtual machine work - showing the robustness and performance of the system by compiling and executing a game of pong. Below is the link to the testing video:
